## Sections of an R Help File

Each R help file has a standard set of sections. Not every help file will have
every section, but all help files will have the starred sections in the list
below. The sections of an R help file in order are:

  * [Title*][title_l]
  * [Description*][desc]
  * [Usage*][use]
  * [Arguments*][arg]
  * [Details][dets]
  * [Value][val]
  * [Note][note]
  * [References][refs]
  * [Author(s)][auts]
  * [See Also][see]
  * [Examples*][ex]
  
## Title

![](img/summary_title.png)

This is the section at the top of the help file and tells you the name of the 
documentation page you are looking at as well as the package the documentation
file is from (enclosed in {}). It also displays a very brief summary of what the
function does in large lettering. While the title is not something I use
regularly, I do occasionally need to figure out what package a particular
function lives in and the title is a great place to do that.

If the package that contains the function is the "base" package, that means it
is a part of "base" R, or the the set of functions and classes available to you
whenever you open an R session. The packages stats, graphics, utils, datasets,
methods, and grDevices are also always loaded whenever you open an R session, so
you don't need to call them with `require` or `library`.

## Description

![](img/summary_description.png)

The Description section gives a more detailed description of what the function
or package does. It is not generally helpful for troubleshooting. However, it is
useful when trying to determine whether or not a function would suit your needs
for a particular task.

## Usage


The Usage section is the first regularly useful section, and one of the sections
I commonly look at when troubleshooting. It is also probably the most difficult 
to interpret. In general, it gives you information about how to *use* the
function. 

Every Usage section will have at least one example function call with
the named arguments listed out. Arguments with an `=` after them have a default
value and therefore do not necessarily need to be provided when using the
function, assuming you don't mind the default values. If there is no `=` after
the argument, it is a required argument and you will need to provide it each 
time you call the function. The Usage section does not describe what each
argument does. For that, you need to go to the Arguments section, which we will
cover next. In general, the Usage and Arguments sections are closely links and 
I often find myself jumping back and forth between them when trying to 
understand what a function is doing.

Sometimes developers document multiple functions in a single help file. This is
the case for `read.table` and `read.csv`, which share a documentation page. 
Even though two functions share a documentation page, that does not mean they
share all the same arguments or default values. For example, the default value
for the header argument is `FALSE` for `read.table` but `TRUE` for `read.csv`.

If there is more than one example function call of the same function in the
Usage section, that generally means that there is more than one version of the
function R can use. Which version of the function R uses depends on the object
class of the first argument passed to the function. Methods refer to functions
that are specific to a given class of object.

When there is more than one method listed in a given documentation file,
the file will tell you which class of object that particular method applies to
using a comment just above the function call with language like "method for class X" or
"method for signature X". This tells you that the arguments listed inside that
call are the arguments you need to run that method if your first argument has a
class of X, as well as the default values.

![](img/summary_usage.png)

For example, if we summarize survey data from the [General Social Survey][gss]
as a data.frame, R displays a maximum of 7 different values for categorical
variables. 

```{r}

library(forcats)

summary(gss_cat)

```

However, if we summarize one column of the data set, the summary function 
displays many more categories.

```{r}

summary(gss_cat$relig)

```

Going back to the documentation for `summary()`, we can see that for a 
data.frame the default value for maxsum is 7, while for a factor, the default 
value for maxsum is 100. Now, this is one difference between these to versions
of the summary function, but to determine if this is the reason the outputs 
are different, we will need to refer to the Arguments section.

## Arguments

The Arguments section lists out the name each argument to the function, what
class of object it needs to be, and a description of what the argument does. It
is probably the section I use most commonly use when troubleshooting. If there
are multiple functions listed in the Usage section, it is possible not every
function will use every argument. You will need to refer to the Usage section to
determine if a given argument applies to the function you are using. To figure
out what the maxsum argument actually does, we refer to the arguments section of
the `summary()` help file.

![](img/summary_arguments.png)


You may see `...` as one of the arguments in the Arguments and Usage sections.
This "argument" allows you to pass arguments to the function that are not
explicitly listed in the function's documentation. This is typically done for
two reasons.

First, the function's author many not want to restrict the number of arguments
you can provide to the function. This is the case for functions like `sum()` and
`data.frame()`. It would be pretty silly for the R developers to limit the
number of columns you could create a data.frame with.

```{r}

sum(1:10, 99, 21:91)


data.frame(x=1:12, y=month.name, z=month.abb)

```

Second, the author of a given function may want to allow other packages to 
expand the functionality of that function. However, the original author won't
necessarily know what arguments will be useful for future R developers. So 
instead, they can include `...` as an argument, and then other packages can
define additional arguments that will be useful to them.

The plot function is one example of this. If you look at the documentation for
the generic plot function, you can see that there are only a few arguments
listed, and they seemed to be geared toward X-Y plotting. This is very useful,
but it is definitely not the only type of plotting you may want to do. 

In fact, many different packages define types of objects (classes) that benefit from visualization.
Instead of creating an entirely new function for just that class, the package's
creator can make a version of `plot()` (aka method) that will display objects of their class.
The sf package uses this functionality. The sf package defines the `sf` class,
which stores geographical information, like the counties of North Carolina. This
is the type of data we use to make maps.

```{r read_nc}
library(sf)

#read in North Carolina data
nc = st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)

#class of data created using sf package
class(nc)

head(nc)

```


If we open up the R help file for plot after loading sf using `?plot`, we have
the option to select documentation for the plot function in the sf package by
clicking on the link labeled "plot sf object". In the `sf::plot` help page there
are many more arguments listed in the Usage and Arguments sections. In
particular, we can specify the position of the key (legend), plot the data on a
log scale, and add a title.

```{r plot_nc}

plot_title = 'Live Births in North Carolina from 1974-1978'

plot(nc['BIR74'], key.pos=1, logz=TRUE, main=plot_title)
```

## Details

The this section generally contains information that is important but may not
clearly fit in any of the other sections. It is often where I go looking for
help when I run into a problem that I can't easily solve. Details covers the
"behavior" of a function, or how a function accomplishes its task. This is
especially important for functions that "behave" differently when you change the
value of certain arguments. The help file for the covariance and correlation
functions (`cov` and `cor`) is one example of this. The Details section
describes how the functions work for each of the five options for the `use`
argument. This includes telling you that one of them ("pairwise.complete.obs")
only works if you use `method="pearson"`. If the function in question implements
a mathematical formula, the Details section may also include the formula, like
in the case of `?dist`.

## Value

The Value section tells you what a function will return after it completes. If
you save the output of the function to a variable, this is the information that
will be stored in the variable. The Value section will generally specify the
class of the object as well the information the object contains. Some functions
do not return a value. If this is the case, the Value section may specify that
the function doesn't return anything or the Value section may be missing. Just
because something displays in your console after running a function does not
mean R returned anything (see [str][str_rd]).

## Note

The Note section is a second Details section for less critical pieces of
information. In the help file for the data.frame function, it tells us that 
if we need code to be compatible with versions of R earlier than R 2.4.0, the
class of our row.names argument needs to be a character vector. While this is
undoubtedly useful for a very small subset of users, most of us don't need to 
worry about that.

## References

If the function implements a formula, statistical method, algorithm, procedure,
or data structure developed elsewhere, the References section will include the
citation for the original source. The References section for the data.frame
function cites a textbook on the S programming language, R's precursor.

## Author(s)

## See Also

If the function whose documentation you are reviewing doesn't do exactly what
you want, this is a good section to puruse. See Also contains links to the
documentation files for functions that are similar to the function to the
function you are investigating. This could include functions that implement a
modified formula (like weighted means), or methods that are implemented for a
different class like the summary method for a linear regression model (`lm`)
object.

## Examples

The Examples section is by far the most useful section for beginners. It 
contains example code that can be run on any computer without loading any
additional packages or data. You can copy and paste it into your console and it
should just work. It is a great place to start if you have absolutely no 
experience with a function or package, or if you have tried everything
and nothing seems to work. 

The Examples section can also be a good place to get code to tinker with when 
trying to understand how a function works. For example, if you don't understand 
the description of the `digits` argument in the `summary()` documentation, you 
can use the code in 

```{r}

#copied directly from the Examples section
summary(attenu, digits = 4)

```

We can then modify the digits argument to see what effect this has on the 
function's output.

```{r}

summary(attenu, digits = 1)

```

It is rare that the code in the Examples section will do exactly what you want
right off the bat. That does not mean the code is not useful. The key is to use
this code as a starting point, code that you know runs, and then work from
there.
