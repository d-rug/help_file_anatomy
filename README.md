## Description

The R programming language has a vast and sprawling documentation library, and
a lot of it is in a standardized format: the R help file. Unfortunately, R help 
files can be difficult to read at the best of times, and almost impossible to
understand for those new to coding. This workshop will explain each section 
of the R help file, how to read them, and when they are the most useful. It 
will also introduce you a number of ways to search R documentation, both from R
and on the internet.

## Learning Goals

  * Know where to look for R documentation depending on what type of question 
  you need answered
  
  * Understand what information each section of a R help file contains 
  
  * Know which help file sections to look at depending on what type of problem
  you have
