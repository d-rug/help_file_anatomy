## Description

The R programming language has a vast and sprawling documentation library, and
a lot of it is in a standardized format: the R help file. Unfortunately, R help 
files can be difficult to read at the best of times, and almost impossible to
understand for those new to coding. This workshop will explain each section 
of the R help file, how to read them, and when they are the most useful. It 
will also introduce you a number of ways to search R documentation, both from R
and on the internet.
